				<td>This is <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Za%27atar">Za'atar</a></b>. It's a very common mixture - probably as common as salt and pepper. It is based on a plant called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origanum_syriacum">Origanum syriacum</a></i>, which gives it its unique tatse. Use it on chicken breast or fresh salads, or even on bread with white cheese.</td>

				<td width="20%"><img src="cumin.jpg" style="max-height: 300px"></td>
				<td>This is <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumin">Cumin</a></b>. This spice also bears a very distinct taste. It goes great with chickpeas (Hummus) and chicken too. I also add it to Bolognese sauce, to give it an extra kick.</td>

				<td>This is <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_el_hanout">Ras El-Hanout</a></b>, and this I know none of you ever received from me. The name comes from Arabic, which means "head of the store" - as in, that's the best spice there is, so it is presented at the front. It's made from up to 15 different ingredients, and so each store and compamy make a different variation. It goes great with chicken and meat-balls, veal-meat and long-cooked meats.</td>

				<td width="20%"><img src="coffee.jpg" style="max-height: 300px"></td>
				<td>This is <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_coffee">Turkish coffee</a></b>, more commonly referred to as "Black Coffee". It's made from ground and unfiltered coffee beans. This specific one also has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardamom">cardamom</a>, which gives it an extra kick. Preparation is simple: put one heaping teaspoon of coffee in a cup, and pour boiled water over it. Stir well and add sugar (I add half a teaspoon). Let it rest so all the coffee-parts drop to the bottom of the cup, then drink. You do not drink the coffee parts.</td>
